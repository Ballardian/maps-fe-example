**Currently WIP** \
This repo is used to represent the FE file structure and testing for whereisgeorge.app (a private repo).\
Note: this is an example and non-exhaustive (and so the tests won't run etc), but the code is lifted directly from the whereisgeorge production repo.

The objective is to create an intuitive code base, with a focus on maintainable/testable code.
Suggestions are encouraged.
